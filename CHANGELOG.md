# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.0]
### Added
- Support for Symfony 7.4
- Support for `psr/log` 3
- Where no annotation reader is available (on Symfony 7, on Symfony 6.4 with `framework.annotations` disabled, and with
  FrameworkBundle 6.4 and `symfony/routing` 7), the bundle reads its own docblock annotations on `#[Route]` methods and
  their classes with Doctrine's `DocParser`. Names resolve only through the use statements that point into
  `Paysera\Bundle\ApiBundle\Annotation` or a namespace above it, of the declaring class and of every trait it uses, so
  unknown tags and other libraries' imported annotations are ignored. As with Doctrine's annotation reader, PHP must
  keep docblocks (`opcache.save_comments=1`)

### Changed
- The Symfony components the bundle uses directly are required explicitly: `symfony/config`, `symfony/dependency-injection`,
  `symfony/http-foundation`, `symfony/http-kernel`, `symfony/property-access`, `symfony/routing` and `symfony/security-core`
- `Configuration::getConfigTreeBuilder()` declares its `TreeBuilder` return type. Breaking for subclasses that override it
  without the return type: add `: TreeBuilder` to the override
- The services are registered by `PayseraApiExtension` instead of the XML files in `Resources/config`, which are
  removed, so Symfony 7.4 no longer reports that the XML configuration format is deprecated. The service ids, classes,
  arguments, method calls, tags and visibility are unchanged
- `PayseraApiExtension` extends `Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Extension\Extension` instead of HttpKernel's
  `Extension`, which is internal since Symfony 7.1. Breaking for subclasses that call `addAnnotatedClassesToCompile()`
  or `getAnnotatedClassesToCompile()`, which only HttpKernel's `Extension` has: drop the calls
- Optional parameters are declared nullable explicitly (`?Type $parameter = null`), as PHP 8.4 expects
- CI runs the tests on PHP 8.4, on Symfony 7 with PHP 8.2 to 8.4, and with lowest dependencies

### Fixed
- On Symfony 7.1 and later, `LocaleListener` picks the locale from `Accept-Language` the same way as on older Symfony
  versions: there a request for `de-DE`, and from Symfony 7.3 also one for `de`, kept the default locale, because `de`
  matched the internal `default` placeholder

### Security
- On Symfony 6.4 with `framework.annotations` disabled, and with FrameworkBundle 6.4 and `symfony/routing` 7, the
  bundle's docblock annotations, `@RequiredPermissions` among them, were ignored without an error; they are now applied

## [1.8.2]
### Changed
- CI allows packages with security advisories, so Symfony 3.4 and 4.4 jobs can install dependencies with Composer 2.10

### Fixed
- Unsupported `sort` field on paginated endpoints now returns `400 invalid_parameters` instead of `500 internal_server_error`

## [1.8.1]
### Added
- `void` typehint to `PayseraApiBundle::build` method to fix the deprecation message
- PHP 8.3 to CI
### Fixed
- `Call to a member function getClassAnnotations() on null` error in `RoutingAttributeLoader` on Symfony 6

## [1.8.0]
### Added
- Support for PHP 8 attributes
- Support for `doctrine/annotations: ^2.0`

## [1.7.0]
### Added
- Support for Symfony 6.4

### Changed

## [1.6.0]
### Added
- Allow library to work with various version of `paysera/lib-object-wrapper` from `0.1.0`

## [1.5.1]
### Changed
- Changed error handling signatures to work with new versions.

## [1.5.0]
### Changed
- `psr/log` bumped to `^2.0`

## [1.4.0]

## [1.3.1]
### Changed
- Updated the paysera/lib-normalization library.

## [1.3.0]
### Added
- support for PHP 8
- `doctrine/persistence` added

### Changed
- `paysera/lib-normalization-bundle` bumped to `^1.1.0`
- `paysera/lib-normalization` bumped to `^1.2.0`
- `paysera/lib-dependency-injection` bumped to `^1.3.0`
- `doctrine/doctrine-bundle` bumped to `^1.4|^2.0`
- `doctrine/orm` bumped to `^2.5.14|^2.6`

### Removed
- support for PHP 7.0
- `paysera/lib-php-cs-fixer-config`

## [1.2.0]
### Changed
- `paysera_api.listener.locale` listener priority changed.

## [1.1.0]
### Changed
- When using annotations, `RestRequestOptions` will now be available after `kernel.request` event instead of `kernel.controller` one. This allows to show proper REST errors when exceptions are raised in the firewall.

## [1.0.0]
### Changed
- `ErrorNormalizer` does not return keys with `null` values anymore.
This means that you'll get errors like this:

```json
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Expected non-empty request body"}
```

instead of this:

```json
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Expected non-empty request body","error_uri":null,"error_properties":null,"error_data":null,"errors":null}
```

## 0.2.1
### Changed
- `paysera/lib-pagination` bumped to `^1.0`

## 0.2.0
### Changed
- since `paysera/lib-normalization` version `1.0` null keys are not filtered.
